====
.*What TLS version is supported?*
[%collapsible]
====
****
We are using TLS 1.2 for the moment.
****
====
.*How do I take payments through the Zettle APIs?*
[%collapsible]
====
****
It is not possible to take payments through the APIs. However, you can take payments using https://github.com/iZettle/sdk-ios[Zettle Payments SDK for iOS] and https://github.com/iZettle/sdk-android[Zettle Payments SDK for Android].
****
====
.*Do you provide any test or sandbox environment?*
[%collapsible]
====
****
Unfortunately we do not at this time.
****
====
.*Does it cost anything to use your APIs and is there some restriction on the APIs?*
[%collapsible]
====
****
No, it is completely free to use our APIs. The only limitation is that some resources might have rate limiting enabled to ensure service stability.
****
====
.*Why do I receive `HTTP 100 Continue` responses sometimes?*
[%collapsible]
====
****
This is something our framework sends when it has received the request headers and
indicates that the client should proceed to send the request body. What you can do is investigate
the reason why your code does this, or you could traverse the headers until
you find a header with the intended response code. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2964687/how-to-handle-100-continue-http-message[example of handling HTTP 100 Continue] and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14526627/double-http-status-header-on-http-post-to-jersey[ example of handling double HTTP-Status header on HTTP-POST].
****
====

== OAuth
.*Once I have an Access token, how do I use it to authenticate myself?*
[%collapsible]
====
****
The Access token is passed through the `Authorization` header with the format:
`Authorization: Bearer <Token>`. Also, note that on most services you can use the `self`
filter instead of `{organizationUuid}`
****
====
.*Do I need my organization UUID when accessing some of the APIs?*
[%collapsible]
====
****
You can use the `self` path parameter instead of specifying organization UUID in an endpoint.

Example request
[source]
--
GET /organizations/self/accounts/{accountTypeGroup}/balance
--

Or, you can fetch the organization UUID by calling the following endpoint.
[source]
--
GET https://oauth.zettle.com/users/self
--
Example response
[source,json]
--

{
    "uuid": "de305d54-75b4-431b-adb2-eb6b9e546014",
    "organizationUuid": "ab305d54-75b4-431b-adb2-eb6b9e546013"
}

--
After fetching the organization UUID, you can specify it in an endpoint.

Example request
[source]
--
GET /organizations/ab305d54-75b4-431b-adb2-eb6b9e546013/accounts/{accountTypeGroup}/balance
--

For more information on the filter and the endpoint, see xref:/authorization.md[OAuth].

== Product Library
.*I'm using your API to create Products on Zettle. I have a problem when assigning images to products. I used the image API to create an image and it's working, but how do I assign this image to the product I'm creating?*
[%collapsible]
====
****

[source,json]
--
 "imageLookupKeys": [
    "string" // What should I put here?
  ],
  "presentation": {
    "imageUrl": "string", // Should I put the created image URL?
    "backgroundColor": "string",
    "textColor": "string"
  },
--

The image API will return a imageUrl back which can be directly put into the `presentation.imageUrl` field, however we just introduced this and is not fully supported by the portal and the apps yet.

So if you only want to use the information outside of the Zettle apps you might want to use  `presentation.imageUrl`, otherwise use  `imageLookupKeys` and strip away everything except the last part of the imageUrl and place for example `Ta0Tx5E6RpujkDRXheIb5w-sS5EEMfKEee84eojOmcEmQ.jpeg` in `imageLookupKeys` to be able to see the image in the Zettle apps.

Clarification examples:
[source,json]
--
"imageLookupKeys": [
      "Ta0Tx5E6RpujkDRXheIb5w-sS5EEMfKEee84eojOmcEnQ.jpeg"
]
"presentation" : {
      "imageUrl": "https://image.izettle.com/v2/images/o/Ta0Tx5E6RpujkDRXheIb5w-sS5EEMfKEee84eojOmcEnQ.jpeg"
}

== Inventory
.*What is an integration with Inventory typically used for?*
[%collapsible]
====
****
An integration between the Inventory service and an e-commerce system ensures that products and inventory levels are automatically synchronized between the platforms. Integrated merchants can manage in-store and online inventories from one place. They can also compare sales and manage updates for all products. 
****
====
.*Which e-commerce integrations are available for Zettle merchants?*
[%collapsible]
====
****
There are pre-built integrations for Zettle with a number of e-commerce platforms. See https://www.zettle.com/gb/integrations/e-commerce[e-commerce integrations for a list]. You can also build your own e-commerce integrations with the Zettle APIs. Typical integrations often include the Product Library and Inventory APIs.

****
====
.*Is it possible to integrate Zettle with my online marketplace?*
[%collapsible]
====
****
There are many possibilities to integrate Zettle with other systems like accounting, e-commerce, and checkout. See https://www.zettle.com/gb/integrations[Integrations] for an overview of options. Online stores are typically integrating product libraries and inventories, through the Product Library and Inventory APIs. Using these products and inventories are automatically synchronized with the e-commerce system.
****
====
.*How can I upload products or add inventory to POS folders from the API?*
[%collapsible]
====
****
Currently products and inventory can only be added to POS folders from the Zettle user interface. It is not possible to do this from the API.
****
====
.*How can I automatically enable inventory tracking when creating products?*
[%collapsible]
====
****
The Inventory service lets you start tracking of products through the API. After creating a product through the Product Library API, you can immediately start tracking it using the `startTrackingProduct` parameter in `POST /organizations/{organizationUuid}/inventory`. See https://github.com/iZettle/api-documentation/blob/master/inventory-api/user-guides/manage-inventory-tracking/enable-tracking.md[Enable tracking].
****
====
.*How do I automate inventory updates between Zettle and my 3rd-party web shop?*
[%collapsible]
====
****
There are pre-built integrations available for a number of e-commerce platforms, see https://www.zettle.com/gb/integrations[e-commerce integrations]. You can also build your own e- integration using the Product Library and Inventory APIs. This will synchronize inventory updates between Zettle and your web shop. 
****
====
.*How do I handle frequent inventory updates for Zettle integrations with a web shop?*
[%collapsible]
====
The Pusher API lets you manage frequent updates by subscribing to specific events triggered by Zettle. Events can for example be changes to product library or inventories. When an event is triggered, aâ€¯request with event information will be sent in real time. See https://github.com/iZettle/api-documentation/blob/master/pusher-api/overview.md[Pusher API].
****
====
== Finance
.*How do I get sum of all payments, fees, refunds, and invoices?*
[%collapsible]
====
Use `includeTransactionType` parameter in the query for the relevant transaction type or types. Then traverse the list of transactions returned and sum up the amounts.
