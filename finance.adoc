BANK_ACCOUNT_VERIFICATION::: References a transaction which is a refund of the money transferred to the iZettle bank account as a verification of ownership of the nominated bank account, made by the merchant.
The transaction happens only when the merchant has nominated and verified a new bank account for payouts.
PAYOUT::: A payout to the merchant's bank account.
FAILED_PAYOUT::: A previous PAYOUT transaction has failed and is voided by this transaction (money going back to the merchant's liquid account at iZettle).
CASHBACK::: Money given to a merchant to retroactively adjust the card payment fee rate.
CASHBACK_PAYOUT::: Direct payout of a cashback, effectively circumventing the normal flow via the liquid account.

EMONEY_TRANSFER::: An internal transfer between two merchants' iZettle accounts. Only used in Sweden.
TELL_FRIEND::: Money given to a merchant for recommending iZettle.
FROZEN_FUNDS::: In the event of a chargeback initiated by the issuing bank, funds will be removed from the merchant liquid account and marked as frozen, to cover the chargeback. 
If the chargeback is later revoked, the money will be returned to the merchants liquid account with a new, positive, transaction of the same type, effectively voiding the initial
FROZEN_FUNDS transaction.
FEE_DISCOUNT_REVOCATION::: An internal reclaim of outstanding fee discount money if the customer has not consumed the discount within a certain time frame. As these funds are reclaimed from a special fee discount account, the transaction will not be visible on the liquid account.

### Link Finance Transactions With Card Purchases
Finance transactions of types `CARD_PAYMENT`, `CARD_PAYMENT_FEE`, `CARD_REFUND` and `CARD_PAYMENT_FEE_REFUND` can be linked using the field `originatingTransactionUuid` to a card purchase using the `cardPaymentUUID1` field of the payment if using the Purchase API v1 or the `uuid` field of the payment if using the Purchase API v2.

In the case of other transaction types, the value of the `originatingTransactionUuid` is not linkable to a specific card purchase and is not useful for external integrators.

### Payouts
