## Fetch account balance
Returns the balance that is available in a merchant's Zettle preliminary or liquid account at a specific time.

After a payment has been made from a merchant's liquid account to their bank account (daily, monthly or weekly), the balance is usually zero or the minimum balance in the merchant's Zettle Back Office. In other cases, you can see how much money is in the merchant's Zettle account.

```
GET /organizations/{organizationUuid}/accounts/{accountTypeGroup}/balance
```

See example [Fetch current balance for a liquid account](#fetch-current-balance-for-a-liquid-account).
