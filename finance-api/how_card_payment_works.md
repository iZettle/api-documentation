How card payment works
===

After a transaction is made with Zettle by a merchant, the money will go through the following status:
* Day 1, preliminary:
 
   Zettle checks the money with a third-party acquirer who confirms the transaction.
* Day 2, liquid 

  After the third-party acquirer confirms the transaction, the money is ready to be paid out to the merchant. 
* Day 2, paid-out 
  
  Zettle reconciles the transaction to make sure that the correct amount of money will be paid out. Then the merchant will receive the money.
