## Fetch the account balance 
Fetch the balance in one or both of the merchant's preliminary and liquid accounts as follows:
   * To check the balance of transactions that are still being checked by Zettle whether they should be paid out, fetch the preliminary account balance:
     ```
     GET /organizations/self/accounts/preliminary/balance
     ```
   * To check the balance of transactions that are ready to be paid out to the merchant, fetch the liquid account balance:
     ```
     GET /organizations/self/accounts/liquid/balance
     ```

   Example:
   
   The following example fetches account balance in the merchant's preliminary account. The response shows that Â£1 is still being cleared by the acquiring bank.
