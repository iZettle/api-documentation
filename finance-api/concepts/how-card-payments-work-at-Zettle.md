How card payment works
===
For every merchant who makes transactions with Zettle, they have an Zettle account that handles those transactions.

After a merchant makes a transaction with Zettle, the money will go through the following status:
* Day 1, in Zettle preliminary account:
 
   Zettle checks the money with a third-party acquirer who confirms the transaction.
* Day 2, in Zettle liquid account

  After the third-party acquirer confirms the transaction, the money is ready to be paid out to the merchant. 
* Day 2, paid-out 
  
  Zettle reconciles the transaction to make sure that the correct amount of money will be paid out from the merchant's Zettle account to the merchant's bank account. Then the merchant will receive the money.
