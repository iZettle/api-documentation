Pusher API reference
=====================
Pusher is an API that publishes information to the integrator's service. This information is data related to products, purchases, inventory etc. The purpose of this service is to ensure that integrators do not have to poll for data related to specific events. <br/>
An integrator can subscribe to specific events in the Pusher service. When these events get triggered, Pusher service will publish information corresponding to the event to the integrator's service.

Examples of events:
* `PurchaseCreated` - This gets triggered when a purchase gets created.
* `ProductUpdated` - This gets triggered when product information gets updated in the product library.<br/>
  See the list of all [Supported events](#supported-events).

The Pusher service uses Webhooks. Webhooks are HTTP callbacks that receive notification messages for events. To create a webhook, users configure a webhook listener and subscribe it to events. A webhook listener is a server that listens at a specific URL for incoming HTTP POST notification messages that are triggered when events occur.<br/>

### Base URL
https://pusher.izettle.com

### OAuth Scope
In order to create or update a subscription to an event, you will need to be authorized with the corresponding scope.

E.g. you will require the `READ:PURCHASE` scope if you want to subscribe to the `PurchaseCreated` event. See the [list of scopes](#supported-events) corresponding to every event.

See [OAuth2 API](https://github.com/iZettle/api-documentation/blob/master/authorization.adoc) for more information on how to get authorization for a particular scope.

## Create a subscription

Creates a webhook subscription to a specific event. 

Once the subscription for an event gets created successfully, Pusher service will publish data on the integrator's service whenever that event occurs.<br/>
E.g. Let's say that you created a subscription for the ```ProductUpdated``` event. Once this is done, whenever a product gets updated in the product library and the `ProductUpdated` event occurs, you will receive event data i.e, payload for the updated product on the ```destination``` server that you have exposed publicly.
See a list of [payloads](user-guides/event-subscriptions.md#payloadAPITable) for all events.

The service will push data for an event only once. However, there may be cases where it gets published more than once. The integrator will then have to take care to not save the data more than once.

```
POST /organizations/{organizationUuid}/subscriptions
```

See [Create a subscription example](#create-a-webhook-subscription).
