=== [[Discounts]]__Discounts explained__
====
Discounts can exist both on a specific row of items(products), as well as on the entire purchase.
Discount on a row of items is applied on the whole amount of the row, can be set either as a percentage or as a fixed amount.

Items row discounts will be applied first, followed by the discount on the sum of the already discounted row prices.

*VAT calculation on purchase with discounts*

Since each row of items can have a separate VAT percentage the discount
for the whole purchase is evenly distributed over all purchased items.
VAT is calculated after all the discounts are deducted.

If the purchase discount is a fixed amount then that amount  will be deducted from each row according the price of each row in relation to the total purchase price.

*Examples*

If the purchase discount is 20%, then the price of each row of item will be deducted with 20% before calculating the VAT for each row.

If a purchase has a total price of 100 and contains 2 rows with the first row priced at 40 and the second at 60, then 40% of the fixed purchase discount will be deducted from the first row and 60% from the other row before calculating the VAT.

* Row discounts are expressed using the following JSON structure in the `products` list, containing either `amount` for fixed discounts or `percentage` for percentage discounts.
The `discountValue` field following the `discount` structure contains the total discount amount for the row:
+
--
[source,json]
----
"discount": {
    "name": "10% off",
    "quantity": 1,
    "percentage": 10
},
"discountValue": 1000
----

*Note:* Currently only one discount per row of items is supported so the `quantity` field will always be set to 1. This could potentially change in the future.
--

* Discounts for the whole purchase are expressed using the following JSON structure.
+
--
They can contain either `amount` or `percentage` value.

[source,json]
----
"discounts": [
{
    "amount": 2000,
    "quantity": 1
}
----

*Note:* Currently only one discount for the whole purchase is supported, so the `discounts` list will only contain one item with `quantity` set to 1. This could potentially change in the future.

See further below for a full response example containing discounts.

*Discount calculation example*

This example purchase contains both discounts on rows and on the whole purchase.

[cols="3%,20%,20%,20%,27%"]
|===
|Nr|Product|Unit price|Amount|Discount
|1|Foo|20|2|5
|2|Bar|10|10|10%
4+|Purchase discount| 20%
|===

1. To calculate the total discount we start by calculating the discount per row:
+
--
First row contains 2 items and a fixed discount amount of 5.

Second row contains 10 items and a percentage discount of 10%.

*Row discounts* = 5 + 10 × 10 × 0.1 = 15
--
2. Then we calculate the purchase discount, based on the sum of the previously discounted rows:
+
--
*Sum of discounted rows* = 20 × 2 + 10 × 10 - 15 = 125

*Purchase discount* = 125 × 0.2 = 25

So the total discount on this purchase is 15 + 25 = 40 and the total sum to pay is 140 - 40 = 100.

A discount can never be greater than the actual amount of the row or purchase price.
